I run a yum repository for a few packages that are not available and/or too old in the standard Enterprise Linux repositories. 

* CentOS 6: [SRPMS][centos-6-srpms] [i686][centos-6-i686] [x86_64][centos-6-x86_64]
* Fedora Rawhide: [SRPMS][fedora-rawhide-srpms] [x86_64][fedora-rawhide-x86_64]


[GPG Key][gpg-key]

**WARNING:** I am not giving instructions on how to enable for a simple reason. The stuff in there is experimental; as such if you do not know how to enable it from this information it is probably best that you leave it alone. If you do, then good luck :)
