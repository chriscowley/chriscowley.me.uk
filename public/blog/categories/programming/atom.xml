    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At <a href="http://www.snellgroup.com" target="_blank">Snell</a> we make heavy use of self-signed certificates for internal websites, such as the R&amp;D wiki. Active Directory makes it easy for us to make this transparent to the users, those that use Firefox/Chrome can find our well-published instructions to add the CA certificate to their own browsers.</p>

<p>Today I was writing a script to that pulls lots of attachments off our Confluence wiki, which we access through SSL using one of those certificates. Of course PyCurl  moaned that it could not verify the host, but I did not care – I know it is the right host!</p>

<p>Finding documentation both on SSL and PyCurl is problematic at best. OpenSSL’s documentation it complete, but could not be more unreadable if written by a right-handed doctor using a broken crayon with his left-hand; pyCurl’s documentation is non-existent.</p>

<p>After an hour of Google-Fu and DuckDuckGo-Fu I finally managed to do what I wanted:</p>

<p>{% include_code pycurl_ssl.py %}</p>

<p>There you go!</p>
