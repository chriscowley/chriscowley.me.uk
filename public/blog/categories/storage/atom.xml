    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="right" src="/images/NetappClustering.jpg">I've had a another bee in my bonnet recently. Specifically, it has been to do with hardware vs software RAID, but I think it goes deeper than that. It started a couple of months back with a discussion on <a href="http://redd.it/18dp63">Reddit</a>. Some of the comments were:</p>

<blockquote><p>Get out, get out now.</p>

<p>while he still can..</p>

<p>WHAT!?
60 TB on software raid.
Jeezus.</p>

<p>Software raid? Get rid of it.</p></blockquote>

<p>It then got re-awakened the other day when Matt Simmons (aka <a href="http://www.standalone-sysadmin.com/blog/">The Standalone Sysadmin</a>) asked the following question on Twitter:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>So what are the modern arguments for / against hardware / software RAID? I don't get out much. <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23sysadmin">#sysadmin</a></p>&mdash; Matt Simmons (@standaloneSA) <a href="https://twitter.com/standaloneSA/status/319932013492703233">April 4, 2013</a></blockquote>

<p>At the time of writing, 2 people replied: myself and <a href="http://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/">Chris Siebenmann</a>. Both of us basically said software RAID is better, hardware is at best pointless.</p>

<p>First of all, I need to define what I mean by hardware RAID. First, I do not care about what you are using for your c:\ drive in Windows, or your / partition in Linux. I am talking about the place where you store your business critical data. If you file server goes down, that is a bad day, but the business will live on. Lose your business data, then you will be out of a job (most likely alongside everyone else). Hardware RAID can thus fall into to categories:</p>

<ul>
<li>a bunch of disks attached to a PCI-e card in a big server</li>
<li>an external storage array. This could be either SAN or NAS, once again I do not care in this instance.</li>
</ul>


<p>I am firmly of the opinion that hardware RAID cards should no longer exist. They are at best pointless and at worst a liability. Modern systems are so fast that there is no real performance hit. Also management is a lot easier; if you have a hardware array then you will need to load the manufacturer's utilities in order to manage it. By manage, I mean to be told when a disk has failed. On Linux, there is no guarantee that will work. There is a couple of vendors that require packages from RHEL4 to be installed on RHEL6 systems to install their tools. Also, they are invariable closed source, will most likely taint my kernel with binary blobs and generally cause a mess on my previously clean system. By contrast, using software RAID means that I can do all the management with trivial little scripts that can easily be integrated with any monitoring system that I choose to use.</p>

<p>I can understand why people are skeptical of software RAID. There have been performance reasons and practical reasons for it not to be trusted. I'm not going to address the performance argument, suffice to say that RAID is now 25 years old - CPUs have moved on a lot in that time. I remember when the first Promise IDE controllers came out, that used a kind of pseudo-hardware RAID - it was not pretty. The preconceptions are compounded by the plethora of nasty controllers built in to consumer motherboards and (possibly worst of all) Window's built in RAID that was just bad.</p>

<p>The thing is, those days are now a long way behind us. For Linux there is absolutely no need for hardware RAID, even Windows will be just fine with an motherboard based RAID for its c: drive.</p>

<p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='I would say that hardware RAID is a liability'>
In fact I would say that hardware RAID is a liability. You go to all that effort to safe-guard your data, but the card becomes a single-point-of-failure. It dies, then you spend your time searching Ebay for the same model of card. You buy it, then you pray that the RAID data is stored on the disks and not the controller (not always the case). By contrast, if you use software RAID and the motherboard dies, then you pull the disks and plug them into whatever box running Linux and you recover your data.
</span></p>

<p>There is definitely a time and place for an external array. If you are using virtualisation properly, you need shared storage. The best way to do that, 9 times out of 10, is with an external array. However, even that may well not be as it seems. There are some that still develop dedicated hardware and come out with exciting gear (HP 3Par and Hitachi Data Systems spring to mind). However, the majority of storage is now on Software.</p>

<p>Let take a look at these things and see just how much "hardware" is actually involved.</p>

<p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='Since the Clariion CX4 EMC has been using Windows Storage Server'>
The EMC VMAX is a big, big black box of storage. Even the "baby" 10k one scales up to 1.5PB and 4 engines. The 40k will go up to 3PB and 8 engines. Look a little deeper (one line further on the spec sheet) and you find that what those engines are: quad Xeons (dual on the 10/20k). The great big bad VMAX is a bunch of standard x86 servers running funky software to do all the management and RAID calculations. What is that funky software? Since the Clariion CX4 EMC has been using Windows Storage Server (based on XP).
</span></p>

<p>Like its big brother, the VNX also runs Windows Storage server on a pair of Xeon servers. Move along to EMC's other lines we find Isilion is nothing more than a big pile of Supermicro servers running (IIRC) FreeBSD. That big box of backup (Avamar) is also a bunch of Supermicro servers, this time running SUSE Linux.</p>

<p>Netapp's famed FAS range similarly runs on commodity hardware,OnTAP is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetApp_filer">BSD</a> based.</p>

<p>The list goes on, Dell Compellent? When I looked at it in early 2012, it was still running on Supermicro dual Xeons. The plan was to move it to Dell R-series servers as soon as possible. They were doing validation at the time, I suspect the move is complete now. Reading between the lines, I came away with the impression that it runs on FreeBSD, but I do not know for sure. CoRAID use Supermicro servers, they unusually run Plan9 as their OS. HP StoreVirtual (formerly Lefthand) runs or Proliant Gen8 servers or VMware. In all these cases, there is no extra hardware involved.</p>

<p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='The people that write the MD stack in the Linux kernel are not cowboys'>
The people that write the MD stack in the Linux kernel are not cowboys. It has proved over and over again that is both stable and fast. I have trusted some of the most important data under my care to their software:  for many years the ERP system at <a href="http://www.snellgroup.com">Snell</a> has been running on MD devices quite happily. We found it much faster than the P410 cards in the DL360G5 servers that host it. Additionally, you do not need to load in any funky modules or utilities - everything you need to manage the devices is there in the distribution.
</span></p>

<p>ZFS also recommends to bypass any RAID devices and let it do everything in software, as does Btrfs. With <em>Storage Spaces</em> in Server 2012 Microsoft is definitely angling towards software controlled storage as well.</p>

<p>As with everything in IT, hardware is falling by the wayside in storage. Modern processors can do the processing so fast that there is no performance need for hardware in between your OS and the disks any more. The OS layers (Storage Spaces on Windows and especially MD/LVM on Linux) are so mature now that their reliability can be taken as a given. With the management advantages, there really is no technical reason to stick with hardware RAID. In fact the closer you can get the raw disks to your OS the better.</p>

<p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='we need to know what is inside that magic black box, especially when it is in the spec sheet'>
As I said at the start, the subject here is software vs hardware RAID, but my problem goes deeper than that particular argument. As technology professional, we are technical people. We need to understand what is going on under the bonnet - that is our job! It may be fine for a vendor to pull the wool over a CFO's eyes, but we need to know what is inside that magic black box, especially when it is in the spec sheet.

    <id>http://www.chriscowley.me.uk/blog/2013/03/01/thoughts-on-the-shiney-new-vmax</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="right" src="http://www.emc.com/R1/images/EMC_Image_C_1310593327367_header-image-vmax-10k.png"> I've spent a significant amount of time recently swatting up on EMC's new <a href="http://chucksblog.emc.com/chucks_blog/2013/02/introducing-vmax-cloud-edition.html">VMAX Cloud Edition</a>. It has to be said that this looks like one of the most interesting storage announcements I have seen in a long time. In fact I have a project coming up that I think it may well be a perfect fit for.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>First a massive thanks to EMC's Matthew Yeager (@mpyeager) who answered a couple of questions I had. He really went the extra mile to clarify a couple of things and the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WoElTAevLDs">video</a> he made is well worth a watch. Also Martin Glassborow (@storagebod) has <a href="http://www.storagebod.com/wordpress/?p=1293">interesting things to say</a> as well.</p>

<p>This is a product that could put a lot of people out of a job. If you are the sort of person who likes to keep hold of your little castle's of knowledge then you will not like this from what I can see. Finally we are able to be truly customer focused, balancing cost, performance and capacity to give them exactly what they want. EMC claim this is a world first and to my knowledge they are right.</p>

<p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='With that amount of data the amount of art involved diminishes'>
Storage architects put a lot of time and effort in to tweaking quotes and systems to balance price, capacity and performance for a given work load. However, most of this is just reading up on the best-practises for a given array and situation and applying them. There is nothing that clever to it - reading and practise is what it comes down to. However, it has alway been as much an art as a science because an individual architect does not have a very large dataset to refer to. On the other hand EMC have got 60 million hours of metrics across more than 7000 VMAX systems out in the field. With that amount of data the amount of art involved diminishes and it becomes purely a science.
</span></p>

<p>What you get is a <a href="http://www.emc.com/storage/symmetrix-vmax/vmax-10k.htm">VMAX 10k</a>, but instead of defining storage pools, tiering policies, RAID levels etc you balance 3 facters: Space, performance and cost. Need a certain performance level for a certain amount of space no matter the cost? Just dial it in and mail EMC a cheque. Have a certain budget, need a certain amount of space, but performance not a problem? Same again.</p>

<p>No longer will we  be carefully balancing the number of SATA and FC spindles and the types of RAID level. No longer will be worrying about what percentage of our workload we need to keep on the SSD layer to assure the necessary number of IOPS. We will not even be calculating how much space we have after the RAID overheads.</p>

<p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='Here we have the abilty to easily integrate a VMAX with the likes of OpenStack Cinder, Puppet, Libvirt, or whatever'>
That is all very interesting, but so far it is just a new approach to the UI. It is an excellent approach, but nothing especially clever. One of things I gravitated towards was the white paper about integrating with <a href="http://www.emc.com/collateral/white-papers/h11468-vmax-cloud-edition-wp.pdf">vCloud</a>. Despite it being geared toward VMware (I wonder why? - not!) the principles equally apply to any situation where automation is required. I am a huge DevOps fan (Puppet in particular). Storage arrays have never been particularly automation friendly. In addition to the cloud portal, the VMAX CE also has a RESTful API. Now that is awesome! Here we have the abilty to easily integrate a VMAX with the likes of OpenStack Cinder, Puppet, Libvirt, or whatever you want.
</span></p>

<p>Finally <a href="http://virtualgeek.typepad.com">Chad Sakac</a> informs me that VMAX CE is just the first. EMC intend to roll this management style out to other product lines. Personally I think this would suit both Isilion and Atmos lines very nicely.</p>

<p>I am really excited about this product. It brings a paradigm shift in storage management and automation. Also I am led to believe that the price is exceptional as well, to point that it seems EMC may even be pushing VNX down a market level (to where it should be perhaps?). I have been <a href="/blog/2012/12/10/emc-extremio-thoughts/">a bit nasty</a> to EMC in the past, but recently they are doing some stuff that has really got me interested. This and <a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/Razor">Razor</a> are 2 projects that are definitely worth keeping an eye on.</p>

    <updated>2013-02-25T13:09:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.chriscowley.me.uk/blog/2013/02/25/the-linux-to-storage</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Martin "Storagebod" Glassborow recently wrote an interesting article where he asked "Who'll do a Linux to Storage?". As someone who is equal parts Storage and Linux, the same question runs around my head quite often. Not just that, but how to do it. It is safe to say that all the constituent parts are already in the Open Source Ecosystem. It just needs someone to pull them all together wrap them up in an integrated interface (be that a GUI, CLI, an API or all).</p>

<!--more -->


<p>Linux, obviously, has excellent NFS support. Until recently it was a little lacking in terms of block support. <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/iscsitarget/">iSCSI Enterprise Target</a> is ok, but is not packaged for RHEL, which for most shops makes it a big no-no. Likewise <a href="http://stgt.sourceforge.net/">TGT</a> is not bad, I have certainly used it to to good effect, but administering it is a bit like pulling teeth. Additionally, neither are VMware certified and I am pretty sure that TGT at  least is missing a required feature for certification as well (may be persistent reservations). There is a third SCSI target in Linux though: <a href="http://www.linux-iscsi.org/">LIO Kernel Target</a> by Rising Tide Systems. This is a lot newer, but is already VMware Ready certified. Red Hat used it in RHEL6 for FCoE target support, but not for iSCSI. in RHEL7 they will be <a href="http://groveronline.com/2012/11/tgtd-lio-in-rhel-7/">using it for all block storage</a>. It has a much nicer interface than the other targets on Linux, using a very intuitive CLI, nice JSON config files and a rather handy API. Rising Tide are a bit of an unknown however, or at least I thought so. It turns our that both QNAP and Netgear use LIO Kernel Target in their larger devices - hence the VMware certification. In any case, Red Hat are behind it, although I think they are working on a fork of at least the CLI, so I think success is assured there. That solves the problem of block storage, be it iSCSI, Fibre-Channel, FCoE, Infiniband or even USB.</p>

<p>Another important building block in an enterprise storage system is some way of distributing the data for both redunancy and performance. Marin mentions <a href="http://ceph.com/">Ceph</a> which is an excellent system. Personally I would put my money on <a href="http://www.gluster.org/">GlusterFS</a> though. I have had slightly better performance from it. Red Hat bought Gluster about a year ago, and have put some serious development effort into it. As well as POSIX access via Fuse, it has Object storage for use with OpenStack, a native Qemu connector is coming in the next versions. Hadoop can also access it directly. There is also a very good Puppet module for it, which gets around one of Martin's critisms of Ceph.</p>

<p>Which brings me nicely to managing this theoretical system. Embedding Puppet in this sort of solution would also make sense. There will be need to a way of keep config sync'ed on all the nodes (I mentioned that this disruptive product will be scale-out didn't I? NO? OK, it will be - prediction for the day). Puppet does this already very well, so why re-invent the wheel.</p>

<p>All this can sit on top of Btrfs allowing each node to have up to 16 exabytes of local storage. For now I am not convinced by it, at least on RHEL 6 as I have seen numerous kernel panics, nor did I have a huge amount of joy on Fedora 17, but there is no doubt that it will get there. Alternatively, there is always the combination of XFS and LVM. XFS is getting on a bit now, but it has been revived by Red Hat in recent years and it is a proven performer with plenty of life left in it yet.</p>

<p>After all that, who do I think is ripe to do some serious disrupting in the storage market? Who will "Do a Red Hat" as Martin puts it? Simple: it will be Red Hat! Look at the best of breed tools at every level of the storage stack on Linux and you will find it is either from Red Hat (Gluster) or they are heavily involved (LIO target). They have the resources and the market/mind share to do it. Also they have a long history of working with and feeding back to the community, so the fortuitous circle will continue.</p>

    <link href="http://www.chriscowley.me.uk/blog/2013/02/21/something-from-the-shadows/"/>
    <updated>2013-02-21T16:06:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.chriscowley.me.uk/blog/2013/02/21/something-from-the-shadows</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>An intriguing startup came out of stealth mode a few days ago. <a href="http://pernixdata.com/">Pernix Data</a> was founded by Pookan Kumar and Satyam Vaghani, both of who were pretty near top of the pile in VMware's storage team.</p>

<!--more -->


<p>What they are offering is, to me at least, a blinding flash of the obvious. It is a softweare layer that runs on a VMware hypervisor that uses local flash as a cache for whatevery is coming off your main storage array. <img class="right" src="http://pernixdata.com/images/home_graphic3.png" width="300" height="217">. That could be an SSD (or multiple) or a PCI-e card.</p>

<p>Reading what they have to say, it is completely transparent to the hypervisor, so everything just works. Obviously me being an Open Source fanatic I imediately started thinking how I could do this with Linux; it took me about 5 minutes.</p>

<p>You take your SAN array and give your LUN to your Hypervisors (running KVM obviously, and with a local SSD). Normally you would stick a clustered file system (such as GFS2) on that shared LUN. Instead you use a tiered block device on top of that LUN. There are two that come immediately to mind: <a href="https://github.com/facebook/flashcache/">Flashcache</a> and <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/tier/files/">Btier</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, you can put your clustered file system on that tiered device. I do not have the time or facilities to test this, but I cannot see why it would not work. Maybe someone at Red Hat (seeing as they do the bulk of KVM and GFS2 development) can run with this and see what happens.
What their plans are I do not know. It is very early days, maybe they will be a success maybe not. As they are both ex-VMware, I would not be at all surprised if they get bought back into the VMware fold. Certainly this is a functionality that I would have like to have seen in the past.</p>

    <link href="http://www.chriscowley.me.uk/blog/2012/12/17/what-will-hp-do-next/"/>
    <updated>2012-12-17T15:16:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.chriscowley.me.uk/blog/2012/12/17/what-will-hp-do-next</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>HP recently announced a new range of 3Par based arrays that are aimed at mid-range enterprise. There now appear to be 2 ranges for the future:</p>

<!--more -->


<ul>
<li>HP StoreServ 10000 is the big boy, scales up to 1.6PB, 192 FC ports, 32 10Gb iSCSI - the works.</li>
<li>HP StoreServ 7000 is the mid-range one, with <em>only</em> 24 FC and 8 1-Gb iSCSI. This split into the 7200 (2U) and 7400 (4U)</li>
</ul>


<p>With the entry level <a href="http://www8.hp.com/us/en/hp-news/press-release.html?id=1332554#.UM8Mm3eTW01">7200 starting at $20k</a> that does not leave a lot of room at the low end for both the P4000 and the P2000 ranges. At the higher end the 7400 starts at $32k, which certainly leaves no space for the venerable EVA.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://h30507.www3.hp.com/t5/Around-the-Storage-Block-Blog/Blogger-Q-amp-A-with-David-Scott/ba-p/128097">an interview with Around the Storage Block</a> HP Storage GM David Scott is quite critical of EMC who have a range of different and fairly unrelated product lines (Atmos, VMAX, VNX/VNXe, Isilion). For now HP is fairly similar: P9000 (Hitachi), P4000 (Lefthand, P2000 (Dot Hill). When you look at where they have priced the 3Par gear, it does appear that they are betting the farm on it.</p>

<p>Something I have been quite vocal about over the last 5 years or so is that fact that HP's storage portfolio is all over the place. Compared to Netapp, who have a very homogenous portfolio (everything runs OnTAP, you know one Netapp product, you can jump on to the rest), HP have got a one interface for P2000, another for P4000, another for EVA. Nothing sits together. HP needs to get all this in line. EMC have already started with Unisphere, but they still have multiple product architectures (VMAX, VNX, Isilion for example).</p>

<p>I personally think that these other ranges will drop by the wayside, although I am reading a bit between the lines here. Dot Hill do seem to be setting themselves up to be more than just an OEM supplier to HP. Maybe it is wishful thinking as I am a <a href="http://www.chriscowley.me.uk/blog/2010/01/12/some-great-new-san-gear/">huge fan of Dot Hill</a>, but they have some very interesting products. I hope/expect to see a lot more of Dot Hill themselves over the next few years, rather than just being behind Oracle/Netapp/HP badges.</p>

<p>The P9000 range is a similar story at the other end of the market. The Storserve 10k seems to be very similar, pretty much the same capacity and number of ports. Feature set is also close enough. I also have the impression that Hitachi are starting to push a bit harder in their own right as well.</p>

<p>Essentially I think 3Par will become HP's own architecture. It has the flexibity to  cover everything from a single bay with 12 SATA disks at the low end (perhaps on DL hardware) all the way up to PB+ scales, taking in all-flash on the way.</p>

<p>This leaves the P4000, which has been re-branded the <a href="http://www8.hp.com/us/en/products/disk-storage/product-detail.html?oid=4118659">StoreVirtual 4000</a>. This seems to me to be a no-brainer. It is already running on commodity DL180 hardware and includes an appliance option. My guess is the physical implementation of this will be phased out. It will become the Virtual Appliance front-end to all this new 3Par based physical goodness.</p>

<p>Finally, I have skipped over the EVA. What does the future hold in store for HP's venerable high-end platform. I think nothing. It will go into maintenance mode and be quietly end-of-life'd. Existing customers will be pushed to <a href="http://h30507.www3.hp.com/t5/Around-the-Storage-Block-Blog/EVA-to-HP-3PAR-StoreServ-online-import/ba-p/128391">migrate</a> over to Storeserv 7000.</p>
