    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>{%img right http://i.imgur.com/RUF1L6e.jpg 200 %}A break from computing today and into the world of nutrition. Cyclists love to talk about nutrition as the nature of our sport makes it a major consideration. I do not really know of any other sport where your fuel gives out before the rest of your body.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>This means that cycling nutrition is big business, and expensive. A typical box of energy bars will cost about 1 euro a bar from a big box pusher, more from your LBS. To that end (as I like baking) I decided to make my own.</p>

<h1>Ingredients</h1>

<p>There is not much to it:</p>

<ul>
<li>200g sugar</li>
<li>120ml oil</li>
<li>2 tablespoons honey</li>
<li>225g porridge oats</li>
<li>250g fruit/nut mix</li>
</ul>


<p>Obviously the quality of these ingredients is all important. With the amount you are saving compared to a commercial bar, one can afford to splash out here. I use:</p>

<ul>
<li>Unrefined sugar</li>
<li>Good quality sunflower oil</li>
<li>Organic honey from a local producer</li>
<li>Good quality, thick rolled oats</li>
</ul>


<p>For the fruit and nut mix you can do whatever you want. We eat a lot of these and get them from a local organic produce shop. I just raid the kitchen draws and see what I come up with. The latest batch had:</p>

<ul>
<li>dried banana</li>
<li>raisins</li>
<li>sultanas</li>
<li>coconut</li>
<li>cranberries</li>
</ul>


<h1>Recipe</h1>

<p>You will need a decent sized saucepan as you'll do all the mixing on the hob. Pre-heat the oven to 180ᵒC (350ᵒF/gas mark 4 I believe).</p>

<p>Start by gently melting together the sugar, oil and honey over a low heat. Be patient, this will take a while.</p>

<p>Add you fruit/nut mix and mix it all in thouroughly. At this point you will need enormous will power as the mixture is delicious and you may find yourself eating it all there and then. This will make you feel rather ill (trust me).</p>

<p>Finally, add the oats a little bit at a time. It is very important to take your time over this. The mixture gets really thick and heavy, which may be too much for your puny cyclist arms. If you can find a way to stir it with your super-mega strong cyclist legs please tell me in the comments. If not, just ask your wife/mother/mother-in-law/child to help.</p>

<p>Once all that is nicly mixed together transfer it to a tin lined with baking paper (25cm x 15cm should be a good size). Make sure it is firmly pressed down with a metal fork. If not the bar will come apart in your pocket (messy).</p>

<p>Put in the oven for about 15 minutes. When it is nicely golden, take it out and leave it to cool before cutting it up. I find this makes 25-30 small bars (~23-50g each), but your mileage may vary.</p>

<h1>Nutritional Information</h1>

<p>Of course, this being a geeky blog I had to do some maths and comparisons. Note that this is all calculated from the information on the packets and searching on the internet. I am an engineer, not a nutritionist so do not take this as gospel.</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th> Bar </th>
<th> weight (g) </th>
<th> Energy (kcal) </th>
<th> Protein (g) </th>
<th> Fat (g) </th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td> Mine </td>
<td> ~25-30 </td>
<td> 134          </td>

<td> 223 </td>
<td> 20 </td>
<td> 6.4 </td>
</tr>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p>Mine do not do too badly. Not that both those commercial options have more everything, but they are also much bigger. Two of my bars would beat both of them hands down in all 3 of those measures. It should also be noted that all the fat in these come from the oil and the oats, which is "healthy fat" according to High 5.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>{% img right http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7120/7645659336_357c65c781.jpg 400 300 %}This is a post which breaks from the normal subjects of Linux and storage.</p>

<p>Today I am going to share a very simple recipe for what I drink when I am cycling. I have some fairly simple requirements for this.</p>

<!-- more -->


<ol>
<li>It must work (it must rehydrate me effectively)</li>
<li>It must not be a rip off</li>
<li>I want to have a at least a reasonable idea of what is in it.</li>
</ol>


<p>You can spend a small fortune on these drinks. Exercise nutrition is big business, but starting at roughly 1 euro a bottle (3-4 euros a day at this time of year, plus my hay fever medicines) they can get pricey.</p>

<p>In reality you need 3 things:</p>

<ol>
<li>Water, and plenty of it</li>
<li>Sugar to give you back the fuel you burn.</li>
<li>Salt to help you absorb the fluid</li>
</ol>


<p>I use  500ml bottles from my <a href="http://www.laboutiqueducycle.fr/">LBS</a> that I chose for very technical reasons (they gave them to me free).</p>

<p>The important thing to get right is the proportions. Not enough sugar and you will not replace the glucose that you burn, too much and you will struggle to absorb it. Likewise with salt, not enough and you're absorption rate will be to slow, too much and it will 1) taste nasty and 2) dehydrate you.</p>

<p>For each 500ml bottle I go for:</p>

<ul>
<li>3 teaspoon sugar (15-20g)</li>
<li>2-3  pinchs of salt</li>
</ul>


<p>That would taste disgusting, so add a touch of fruit squash to taste. I use Grenadine, because the children love it so it always in the fridge, but a sugar-free squash would be fine or a dash for fresh fruit juice. To allow for the extra sugar in the Grenadine, I cut down the added sugar by 1 teaspoon.</p>

<p>Finally, I use unrefined sugar and for the salt I use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gu%C3%A9rande#Salt_marshes">Sel de Guérande</a>. That way I know I am using the best quality ingredients, something I am sure the likes of Gatorade do not do.</p>

<p>Final cost is minimal, but it seems to work for me. Everyone is different, so these levels need adjusting for you.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>{% img right http://www.arkon.com/images/slimgrip/sm532.jpg 300 300 %} A little bit if a move away from computers and related subjects today. I was recently contacted by <a href="http://www.gearzap.com">Gearzap</a>/<a href="http://www.mobilefun.co.uk">MobileFun</a> who had seen that I had a Raspberry Pi. They asked if I would like to review a case and I cheekily asked if they could also give me something to mount my phone on the handlebars of my bike. Much to my pleasant surprise, they said yes.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>The sent me the <a href="http://www.arkon.com/slimgrip/slimgrip-bike-mount.html">Arkon SM532</a>. Unsurprisingly it is made in China, but then what is not nowadays. Having said that, the build quality is pretty good and the instructions pretty clear.</p>

<p>I mounted it on my beloved <a href="http://flic.kr/p/cDCcFd">Felt</a> road bike as it is what I am currently using day to day. This unfortunately highlighted the only real problem I found. Modern road bikes have thicker handle bars than many other types of bike. This meant that fitting the bracket to them was tight. It comes with several rubber shims, that a) protect you handlebars, b) stop it from slipping around. It was not possible to use those. It has to be said that is pretty ugly as well, but if that worries you then buy a Garmin.</p>

<p>Anyway, I persevered and attached it without the shims and prayed that it would not do any damage. As I said, the instructions were very clear and this only took a few minutes.  Once on it all seemed perfectly secure, so the next day I put my phone in it. The clips keep it in place pretty well and the you also have the bungie cord as an extra, so I was not worried it would fall out at all. The route I took is a collection of French farm lanes. Some are very smooth, but some are horrible. Also, it is harvest time, so there is plenty of dried mud on the road to give it a bit more of a shaking. It held up very well, nothing shifted at all and I could easily angle the phone so it was just right.</p>

<p>Later I took it off to ensure that it would fit properly on a "normal" sized handlebar by putting it on my mountain bike - it was fine. Also, there was absolutely no scratches on my Felt's bars at all, despite my concerns about not having any shims to protect them.</p>

<p>All in all it is a pretty good piece of kit. It can be had from <a href="http://www.mobilefun.co.uk">MobileFun</a> for £13.95, which strikes me as pretty good value.</p>
