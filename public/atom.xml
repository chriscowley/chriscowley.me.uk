    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Install Skype – I used <a href="http://slayachronicles.blogspot.co.uk/2012/03/installing-skype-on-fedora-16-64-bit.html" target="_blank" >these</a> instructions. This will seem to get everything working, but video will just give you a black screen and no error message. This is because Skype is 32 bit and you webcam driver is 64 bit. Make sure you have libv4l.i686 installed.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>sudo yum install libv4l.i686</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now create a wrapper script to launch it with a custom environment. I put it in <em>/usr/local/bin/skype</em></p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span> (skype)</span> <a href='http://http://warm-sword-7449.herokuapp.com//downloads/code/skype'>download</a></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This will now get loaded before the main Skype executable and you will have a working video device.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>How many times have you installed/updated a bit of software and read the line “Please take a back up” or something to that effect? 99 times out of a hundred, you will just continue and ignore it.</p>

<p>Today I had a reminder of why it is import to do so. I did a routine plug-in upgrade on our Jira installation (Customware Salesforce connector for those who want to know). I have done this several times, I had tested it in our Dev installation I was 100% confident it would work as expected. However, I actually decided to take a backup anyway.</p>

<p>I ran the upgrade in the production environment and re-indexed. Nothing out of the ordinary. 10% of the way into the index it fell over. Jira’s database was gone! Fortunately I was able to restore from my backup and at worst a comment or two was lost, but that still caused significant downtime.</p>

<p>I had done everything I could to make sure the upgrade would go smoothly, but it still did not. That is why software vendors always tell you to take a backup before even the smallest change – DO IT!</p>

    <id>http://http://warm-sword-7449.herokuapp.com//blog/2012/04/05/pycurl-and-self-signed-ssl-certificates</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At <a href="http://www.snellgroup.com" target="_blank">Snell</a> we make heavy use of self-signed certificates for internal websites, such as the R&amp;D wiki. Active Directory makes it easy for us to make this transparent to the users, those that use Firefox/Chrome can find our well-published instructions to add the CA certificate to their own browsers.</p>

<p>Today I was writing a script to that pulls lots of attachments off our Confluence wiki, which we access through SSL using one of those certificates. Of course PyCurl  moaned that it could not verify the host, but I did not care – I know it is the right host!</p>

<p>Finding documentation both on SSL and PyCurl is problematic at best. OpenSSL’s documentation it complete, but could not be more unreadable if written by a right-handed doctor using a broken crayon with his left-hand; pyCurl’s documentation is non-existent.</p>

<p>After an hour of Google-Fu and DuckDuckGo-Fu I finally managed to do what I wanted:</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This should have nice and simple, but there was a little gotcha (for me anyway).</p>

<p>First install the RPMFusion repositories:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

</span><span class='line'>    http://download1.rpmfusion.org/free/fedora/rpmfusion-free-release-stable.noarch.rpm \
</span><span class='line'>    http://download1.rpmfusion.org/nonfree/fedora/rpmfusion-nonfree-release-stable.noarch.rpm</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now you can install MPD and a simple client with</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>yum install mpd mpc</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>By default it looks in <em>/var/lib/mpd/music</em> which strikes me as reasonable, so copy some music there. Now comes the bit that caught me out; you will need to update is library:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>mpc update</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>A lot of documentation on the net talks about running <code>mpd –create-db</code>, but this is now depreciated. I eventually found this out on Arch Linux’s wiki.</p>

<p>Connect a client and listen to your music – I’m using gmpc (<code>yum install gmpc</code>) which is very feature rich, but if you want something simpler, try Sonata (<code>yum install sonata</code>) or even <em>mpc</em> itself. Finally you can also use you MPDroid on your phone.</p>

    <id>http://http://warm-sword-7449.herokuapp.com//blog/2012/02/22/back-to-basics</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have been a Sys Admin for quite a while now. Specialising in Linux means that I am often called upon to be a “jack of all trades, master of many”. In the last week I have touched upon storage, multiple programming languages (Bash, PHP, Python, Ruby and Java), Linux, Exchange, Tomcat, Virtualization and Systems architecture. I am sure the list could go on … and on … and on …</p>

<p>There is however something that I feel I am missing. Before I was in my current post, I was more of a developer. I did a lot of Shell scripting, but also ADA and C/C++. Nowadays I do not do that, which is a shame. Virtually all modern programming languages trace their roots back to C and C++. The whole of Linux/UNIX traces its roots back to C. Our world is built on C/C++!</p>

<p>This is something I have neglected over recent years, so I’m going to change that. A bit of Google-fu just now has bought me some interesting resources:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/" target="_blank" &gt;http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.howtoforge.com/howtos/programming/c-cplusplus" target="_blank" &gt;http://www.howtoforge.com/howtos/programming/c-cplusplus&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.gtk.org/tutorial1.2/" target="_blank" &gt;http://www.gtk.org/tutorial1.2/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="http://zetcode.com/tutorials/qt4tutorial/" target="_blank" &gt;http://zetcode.com/tutorials/qt4tutorial/&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I have not looked at any of these in detail yet, but I will be over the next few days. At the end I hope to have dragged this hard-earned knowledge kicking and screaming from the back of my mind.</p>

    <id>http://http://warm-sword-7449.herokuapp.com//blog/2012/02/06/vmware-cli-installation-woes-on-centos-6</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Installing the VMware CLI should have been simple, but it was a bit of a fiddle.</p>

<p>Use yum  all the bits it needs:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>yum install make autoconf automake openssl-devel gcc gcc-c++ make uuid-perl libuuid-devel uuid-devel  perl-Data-Dump perl-SOAP-Lite perl-XML-SAX perl-XML-NamespaceSupport perl-XML-LibXML perl-XML-LibXML-Common perl-CPAN</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>You should now be able to run the installer, but I had another problem though. The installer script would not believe me that I had a direct internet connection and insisted that I gave some proxy server settings. As a simple workaround I just commented out that code in the installation script:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
<span class='line-number'>14</span>
<span class='line-number'>15</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>if ( direct_command("env | grep -i http_proxy") ) {
</span><span class='line'> $httpproxy = 1;
</span><span class='line'>} else {
</span><span class='line'> print wrap("http_proxy not set. please set environment variable 'http_proxy' e.g. export http_proxy=http://myproxy.mydomain.com:0000 . \n\n", 0);
</span><span class='line'>}
</span><span class='line'>if ( direct_command("env | grep -i ftp_proxy") ) {
</span><span class='line'> $ftpproxy = 1;
</span><span class='line'>} else {
</span><span class='line'> print wrap("ftp_proxy not set. please set environment variable 'ftp_proxy' e.g. export ftp_proxy=http://myproxy.mydomain.com:0000 . \n\n", 0);
</span><span class='line'>}
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>if ( !( $ftpproxy && $httpproxy)) {
</span><span class='line'>    uninstall_file($gInstallerMainDB);
</span><span class='line'>    exit 1;
</span><span class='line'>}</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>After this I was able to run the installer with no problems. Of course, there is still the problem I have VMware about them putting their files under <em>/usr</em>. If it is not under control of my package manager, the default should be <em>/opt</em> or <em>/usr/local</em>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have searchstorage.co.uk send me potentially interesting white-papers regularly. If I am honest, most of them or thinly veiled press-releases. However occasionally one is interesting.</p>

<p>Today I received one entitled <a href="http://http://warm-sword-7449.herokuapp.com//downloads/ITinEU_Storage_autumn11_final.pdf">Break free of vendor lock-in with open source storage</a>. Being a FLOSS fan and a storage specialist, that obviously intrigued me.</p>

<p>The article of interest starts on page 8 and is pretty good. It mentions all the main players; unusually it is not condescending towards Open Source (i.e. it will get you by until you can afford to buy a proper/stupidly-over-priced solution).</p>

<p>It also mentions <a href="http://www.gluster.org" target="_blank">GlusterFS</a>, which is particularly interesting. I have just built a solution at work built around this and it excellent. I will be putting more info up soon as a complete how-to on building a full-featured, high availability SAN/NAS.</p>

    <link href="http://http://warm-sword-7449.herokuapp.com//blog/2010/05/04/sms-from-icinga-or-nagios/"/>
    <updated>2010-05-04T13:26:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://http://warm-sword-7449.herokuapp.com//blog/2010/05/04/sms-from-icinga-or-nagios</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Finding out how to have Nagios (or in my case Icinga) send SMS alerts is easy. However, from my point of view it fell down in 2 ways.</p>

<ol>
<li>Most of these guides are Debian specific, I am using Centos.</li>
<li>The SMS alerts are all or nothing, I only want SMS alerts for specific services (such as the corporate website).</li>
</ol>


<h2>Hardware</h2>

<p>First things first you need something to send the SMS. I am using a brand new Vodaphone USB dongle taped to the side of the rack . I also had it working with a Nokia E51 using the same tools – obviously this would the require constant charging.</p>

<p>Ideally I would have prefered to use an internal card. PCI -> PC card bridges do exist, but I had no joy on my Icinga server, although it did work in a Dell Optiplex we had lying around, but it caused an HP XW4600 not to switch on at all.</p>

<h2>Software</h2>

<p>I am using <a href="http://smstools3.kekekasvi.com/" target="_blank">SMS Server Tools 3</a> which are available for Centos/RHEL in <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL" target="_blank">EPEL</a>. This gives you an smsd daemon that watches a folder for text messages in a particular format.</p>

<p>When you have enabled EPEL run</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>yum install smstools
</span><span class='line'>chkconfig –levels 35 smsd on</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>When I plugged in the USB dongle I got a pair of USB ttys at /dev/ttyUSB0 and /dev/ttyUSB1</p>

<p>Add the following to /etc/smsd.conf</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>devices = GSM1
</span><span class='line'>logfile = /var/log/smsd.log
</span><span class='line'>loglevel = 7
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>ARVE Error: no video ID
</span><span class='line'>device = /dev/ttyUSB0
</span><span class='line'>smsc = 447785016005 # I am using Vodaphone, your’s may vary.
</span><span class='line'>incoming = no</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now you can start the daemon</p>

<pre><code>/etc/init.d/smsd start
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, for reasons explained later, you need an entry in icinga’s cron.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>* * * * * if [[ `ls /tmp/ | grep 'sms-icinga' | wc -l` -gt 0 ]];then /bin/mv /tmp/sms-icinga* /var/spool/sms/outgoing/;fi</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>What does this do? It checks “/tmp/” for any files that contain the name “sms-icinga” every minute. If any exist it moves them to “/var/spool/sms/outgoing/”. That last folder is watched by smsd for those special text files mentioned above.
Icinga/Nagios configuration</p>

<p>First add the commands, for which I use the file /etc/icinga/objects/commands.conf</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>These commands write a file in /tmp that includes the string sms-icinga that our cron script looks for. The rest of it is to endure we do not accidentally overwrite an alert that has not been sent yet. The reason we need to write it into tmp, and the mv it to the outgoing folder is a little weird. I found that if I wrote directly to the outgoing folder, then smsd seemed picked it up too early and failed to parse the file correctly – strange, but not to worry.</p>

<p>Now is where need to fiddle things a little bit if we only want to send messages for certain critical services. If you want SMS alerts for all your services you can just add a pager entry to all you contacts. We need to create an SMS user and a couple of templates to base our critical stuff on.</p>

<p>The templates:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>

<span class='line-number'>16</span>
<span class='line-number'>17</span>
<span class='line-number'>18</span>
<span class='line-number'>19</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>define contact {

</span><span class='line'>    service_notification_commands notify-service-by-sms, notify-service-by-email

</span><span class='line'>

</span><span class='line'>    use generic-host
</span><span class='line'>    contact_groups admins-sms,linux-admin
</span><span class='line'>}</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>my user:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>define contact {
</span><span class='line'>    contact_name ChrisCowley-SMS
</span><span class='line'>    use sms-contact
</span><span class='line'>    pager &lt;my-mobile-number&gt;
</span><span class='line'>}</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>a contact group:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>define contactgroup {
</span><span class='line'>    contactgroup_name admins-sms
</span><span class='line'>    members ChrisCowley-SMS
</span><span class='line'>}</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Finally we can create our essential service:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>define service {
</span><span class='line'>    use critical-service
</span><span class='line'>    service_description Website-content
</span><span class='line'>    check_command check_http_content!-U http://www.snellgroup.com -m Snell
</span><span class='line'>    host_name www.snellgroup.com
</span><span class='line'>}</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Just before Christmas I was up at a storage seminar run by a company called <a href="http://www.dothill.com/" target="_blank">Dot Hill</a>. Until I was pointed to them when I spoke to our storage supplier about replacing an aging array I had never heard of them. However, it turns out that they make the hardware used by HP, NetApp and others – quite a pedigree then.</p>

<p>All their products are completely modular, based on the same chassis. If you have an iSCSI unit, then you can later change it into a FC one and you do not have to migrate anything as the array config is not stored on the controllers.</p>

<p>They have some very clever technologies as well. In most arrays, the cache on the controllers need to be kept in sync. This generally goes through the backplane. In the Dot Hill arrays, there is dedicated circuitry that goes directly between the controllers – much faster! I also like the fact that they no longer use batteries, but instead use supercapacitors which are much greener.</p>
