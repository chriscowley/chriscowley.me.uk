    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Install Skype – I used <a href="http://slayachronicles.blogspot.co.uk/2012/03/installing-skype-on-fedora-16-64-bit.html" target="_blank" >these</a> instructions. This will seem to get everything working, but video will just give you a black screen and no error message. This is because Skype is 32 bit and you webcam driver is 64 bit. Make sure you have libv4l.i686 installed.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>sudo yum install libv4l.i686</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now create a wrapper script to launch it with a custom environment. I put it in /usr/local/bin/skype</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span> (skype)</span> <a href='http://http://warm-sword-7449.herokuapp.com//downloads/code/skype'>download</a></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="c">#!/bin/bash</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">LD_PRELOAD</span><span class="o">=</span>/usr/lib/libv4l/v4l1compat.so  /usr/bin/skype
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This will now get loaded before the main Skype executable and you will have a working video device.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>How many times have you installed/updated a bit of software and read the line “Please take a back up” or something to that effect? 99 times out of a hundred, you will just continue and ignore it.</p>

<p>Today I had a reminder of why it is import to do so. I did a routine plug-in upgrade on our Jira installation (Customware Salesforce connector for those who want to know). I have done this several times, I had tested it our Dev installation I was 100% confident it would work as expected. However, I actually decided to take a backup anyway.</p>

<p>I ran the upgrade in the production environment and re-indexed. Nothing out of the ordinary. 10% of the way into the index it fell over. Jira’s database was gone! Fortunately I was able to restore from my backup and at worst a comment or two was lost, but that still caused significant downtime.</p>

<p>I had done everything I could to make sure the upgrade would go smoothly, but it still did not. That is why software vendors always tell you to take a backup before even the smallest change – DO IT!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At <a href="http://www.snellgroup.com" target="_blank">Snell</a> we make heavy use of self-signed certificates for internal websites, such as the R&amp;D wiki. Active Directory makes it easy for us to make this transparent to the users, those that use Firefox/Chrome can find our well-published instructions to add the CA certificate to their own browsers.</p>

<p>Today I was writing a script to that pulls lots of attachments off our Confluence wiki, which we access through SSL using one of those certificates. Of course PyCurl  moaned that it could not verify the host, but I did not care – I know it is the right host!</p>

<p>Finding documentation both on SSL and PyCurl is problematic at best. OpenSSL’s documentation it complete, but could not be more unreadable if written by a right-handed doctor using a broken crayon with his left-hand; pyCurl’s documentation is non-existent.</p>

<p>After an hour of Google-Fu and DuckDuckGo-Fu I finally managed to do what I wanted:</p>
